# Deep_imagination_decision_trees
Repository containing all the C codes used for paper "Deep imagination is a close to optimal policy for planning in large decision trees under limited resources" and the Matlab codes to generate the figures.

Codes to generate data and plot are organized in folders according to figures. Please read the readme.txt in every folder to know the code to run.

Montecarlo simulations generated random number using Marsenne twister random generator. If you find results different from the ones uploaded, your compiler may have problems with the random number generator. In every folder we put also the codes to generate the same data with the standard C random function rand().
