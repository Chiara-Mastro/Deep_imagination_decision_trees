# Deep_imagination_decision_trees
Repository containing all the C code used for paper "Deep imagination is a close to optimal policy for planning in large decision trees under limited resources"

Codes to generate data and plot are organized in folders according to figures. Please read the readme.txt in every folder to know which code to play.

Montecarlo simulations generated random number using Marsenne twister random generator. This generator happened to have problems with some compilers. If you find results different from the ones uploaded, you may have problems with the rng. In every folder we put also the codes to generate the same data with the standard C random number generator function rand().
