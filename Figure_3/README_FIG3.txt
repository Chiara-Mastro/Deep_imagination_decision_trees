Run ...capacity.cc with desired parameters to get values for playing the tree through simulations (valid for all p)
If you find results different from the ones provided, please run ...capacity_rand.cc with desired parameters to get values for playing the tree through simulations using rand() function to generate random numbers.

Run ...theory.cc with desired parameters to get analytical value for playing the tree (valid for p=1/2)

Run ...rationals_1.cc with desired parameters to get analytical value for playing the tree (valid for p=1/n+1)

Matlab code plot...fig3_p_0_5.m generates fig3_p_0_05.pdf, plot...ig3_p_0_01.m generates fig3_p_0_01.pdf, from which Fig. 3b, Fig. 3c and 3d.
