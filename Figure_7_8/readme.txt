Run Code_Twob_Homogeneous_1_nplus1.c and Code_Twob_Homogeneous_n_nplus1 to explore the space (p, C) in terms of value and optimal branching factors. Results are analytical and the two codes respectively explore the space for rational values of p=1/(n+1) and p=n/(n+1).

Matlab code plot_Optimal_TwobHomogeneous_fig7.m generates Fig. 7a-7d.
Matlab code plot_Loss_TwobHomogeneous_fig8.m generates Fig. 8a-8b, together with the computation of the loss function.
