Run ...loop2_data.cc to explore the space (p, C) in terms of value and optimal branching factor.
If you find results different from the ones provided, please run ..loop2_data_rand.cc with desired parameters to get values for playing the tree through simulations using rand() function to generate random numbers.

Matlab code plot...fig5.m generates Fig. 5a-5d, together with the computation of the loss function.
